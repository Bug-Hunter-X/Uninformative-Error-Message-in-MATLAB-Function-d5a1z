# Uninformative Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository contains a simple MATLAB function that demonstrates an example of an uninformative error message. The function `myFunction` takes a single input and returns a result. However, if the input is negative, the function throws an error with a generic message. This makes debugging difficult, as the error message doesn't provide enough information to understand the cause of the error.

The `bug.m` file contains the original buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides an improved version with better error handling.
